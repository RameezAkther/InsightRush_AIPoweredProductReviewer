I had high hopes for this gaming laptop, but it has fallen far short of my expectations.First and foremost, the battery life is abysmal. I expected a laptop with decent battery performance, but I can barely get it to last for more than 2 hours of simple usage. It's incredibly frustrating to have to constantly be tethered to a power source when I had hoped to use it on the go. This severely limits its portability and functionality.Moreover, the laptop's performance is far from what I anticipated. With its 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12450H and NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU, I expected smooth gaming and multitasking capabilities. However, I've experienced significant lag and performance issues that make it nearly impossible to enjoy gaming or perform tasks efficiently. It's disheartening to invest in a so-called gaming laptop and have it struggle with even the most basic of tasks.Adding to my disappointment, I've tried reaching out to Amazon's customer service team for assistance with these problems, but they have yet to arrive at my home after two weeks of waiting. The lack of timely customer support is incredibly frustrating and adds to the overall negative experience.In conclusion, the HP Victus Gaming Laptop has been a letdown in every aspect. The short battery life, poor performance, and lack of effective customer support have made this purchase a regrettable one. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and I'm left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with my Amazon shopping experience."

Also there is no second m.2 slot. So you can only use a second storage through USB. Games need a lot of space hence this being a gaming laptop is at a disadvantage.Ram expansion only upto16 GB. And lesser battery capacity.And as it is a gaming laptop, its battery backup is only 2 hours.the fan placing at the bottom is only single side, if they have placing both sides like Asus Predator , then the air flow would have been very good for cooling.Cooling system also bad.There is no light on the number lock button, so sometimes there is confusion whether it is on or off?Go for other laptop which are better then hp victus."

There are some issue with my device in my case the RAM is faulty due to which the game leg and suddenly shutdown but I complaint about it on HP customer care and within a week day test and replace my RAM and then my PC works really well they also gave clean up to my PC and change the coolant.2. And there was issue in my window 11.3. USB ports are only two so you have to buy a for USB hub or any type of hub.4. Camera and mic sucks you have to use external mic and camera.Good things :1. Temperature does not reach above than 90¬∞ C with a cooling pad but I also suggest to use laptop in AC room or infront of coolar or a fan .2. Wobling is not an issue I use my laptop in front of a cooler on a high speed and the screen does not shake a little bit but when you slightly touch the laptop it moves a little bit and it is mandatory to use laptop when the lead is open.3. Gaming experience is quite good and I have no complaint about it I run high and FPS shooting games and high graphic games on it and softwares like unreal engine, Android studio, Da vinci's resolve etc4. Last thing is about their customer care you have to wait for some time on call in my case it take an hour but the solution they give about my problems solve it instantly and for any hardware aur software issue the engineer from HP customer care came to your home repair your PC in front of your eyes in  the engineer from HP customer care came to your home repair your PC in front of your eyes in front  the engineer from HP customer care came to your home repair your PC in front of you oh sometime day take it with them and give it back to you in 2 to 3 days in my case it take 2 days and my PC is completely repaired so I highly suggest you to increase your warranty at the time you buy and check that the warranty was increased by HP itself not by Amazon or any other e-commerce website.###worth it laptop for all category of students and gamers###"
