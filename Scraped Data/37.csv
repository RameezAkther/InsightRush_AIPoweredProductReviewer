5,5,Simply awesome,Review after 2 days of use- Delivery was perfect- Installation was disappointing due to unprofessional behaviour of technician- Look & appearance is nice- Overall Cooling is ok- Running sound is very high and a matter of disturbance to guests as the same is installed in my drawing room (compared to other AC installed in my flat Bluestar/voltas)- lowest temp at AC air delivery point noted as 12degree after 2.15hrs of continuous run at 20 degree setting temp.
6,5,Worth every penny,"Edit:18May : identified sound will be low when autofan mode is selected and set temp is attained. Sometimes ac works like it is dry mode when actually is in cool mode. As of now got adapted and is okay with the ac. Happy now with the purchase.Edit:29 April : After few days of use , the sound issue has popped up. Now I understand on the reviews but wondering why it was not there till yesterday. The sound is now annoying. 25April: Happy with the product. Expected little noise based on feed..."

12,3,Good,"Giving review after 1 month of usage. Positive: 1. Value for money.2. Cooling is good.3. Energy efficient.Negative: 1. Fan is noisy.2. You cannot change fan speed in variable modes, the fan runs at the highest speed which is irritating.  You can see in the remote the speed is changing but actually the fan will run at the highest speed."

16,5,Just wow!,"A very good product..must go for it.. inshanly sleek design, perfect cooling, good support from gedrej service centre.."
17,5,Classy product,It has been about a month now and this ac is doing a good job. I mostly run it at 27 degrees or above and don't find any issues with cooling or even no annoying noise from the outdoor unit as mentioned in some reviews. It runs around 15 hours per day.Will get to know the electricity consumption only once the bill is generated.
18,5,Terrific purchase,"Godrej ac is highly reliable. I couldn't check the current consumption as all gadgets in my house are connected to one power meter.Because it's a convert 5in1 split ac, noise is high in C5 with maximum fan speed in indoor. However if we keep the fan in lowest speed and @ C1, it's very silent with excellent cooling for ground floor room.Only drawback I could note is that the indoor doesn't show the room temprature. It shows only the set temprature. Godrej should incorporate this in future mo..."
