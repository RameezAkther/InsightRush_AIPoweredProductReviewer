1,4,Worth the money,"People should understand their requirements before purchasing. It is not a gaming phone. If you do heavy task over this you might be disappointed. It's for those who are looking for a phone for day to day tasks. Very nice to hold in hands due to its size. Battery, display, ui is excellent. Camera is also usable. I bought it as my secondary phone and I am pretty happy with it. Only one thing I am not currently satisfied is sometimes I feel little lag when I open an app. I hope samsung will fix..."

19,3,Decent product,It's not worth it from a brand like samsung..Battery back up is not upto mark as it has 6000MAH of battery which last only for 24 hours of moderate use..Second front camera is useless.Except for display I didn't find anything worthy.I am samsung phone lover but 1st time I feel like betrayed..

52,4,Delightful,Camera: Rear camera is good..I loved the night mode capture...but there is only 10x zoom and quality is also not good...front camer is okay Battery: It is promised as 2 days Battery backup but it's not Performance: I'm not a gamer nor a heavy user..i only use for daily tasks so for that i loved the Performance Design: Back side of the phone is very classy but it's l'll heavy Display: Loved it I loved the features...overall it's a good phone 👍
53,5,Great product,Superb quality...Display  quality Camera quality Performance all are good...
54,4,Nice product,"Pros1.Display is good 120 hz amoled panel2. Battery backup is also good it lasts more than one full day for me and I will not play games much3. One UI is also good compared to all other mobiles except iOS.. 4. Design is also good with glass protection on front and decent plastic on back, I liked the Design personally, but the camera bump is high, have to use back cover..Cons1. As of now performance is good, but in long run I don't know how exynos processors react, let's see after 3 year..."
55,3,Does the job,This phone has some severe heating and battery drainage issue. I have been using Samsung  for more than 9 years now but this phone is worst. Exynos is a heater not a processor!! And phone is not thin. Don't waste your money.
56,3,Decent product,Display and camera good. Little heating issue..and processor bit slow.
57,4,Wonderful,Nice mobile nice function everything is good but with adaptor it's very expensive...
58,4,Good quality product,"All good but it gets a little too hit fast. The camera is also good, but I didn't notice any difference in the night camera. Besides, I saw that everything was fine. I have been using it for a week. Now let's see how long this phone lasts."
59,4,Worth the money,Review after 1 week of use :1. After setting up the phone it will upgrade to OneUi 6 with Android 14.2. No heating issue as I use my phone in direct sunlight for 3-4 hours.3. Display is really good.4. Battery last for the full day. I'm using my old phone charge which was of Mi 33w. So it charges little quick.5. Camera is okayish.Cons:1. Stereo speaker could be provided2. Can't go above 1080p
60,4,Pretty good,All rounder Mobile
61,5,Highly recommended,This is a best mobile for a non Gamer person But except this I think this is te best phone in this price I bought it for 13000 + 1050(charger )I am ratings itDisplay 10 out of 10Back camera 10 out of 10Front camera 8 out of 10Battery10 out of 10Software 20 out of 10Design 7 out of 10!! My opinion is to buy a case with this immediately It gates to many scratches in 2 days
62,5,Terrific,Mobile is good 😊Camera is awesomeHeats sometime may be due to the processor flagship mobiles also heats don't wworry
63,5,Best in the market!,Writing this after using it for 15 days...A good and decent mobile in this price range. Performance is good without any lag.

Smooth settings and display!A petition to samsung to give charger along with mobiles🥲😅!!!
64,5,Awesome,Camera 100%Battery 100%Display 100%Performance 100%Design 60%Giving rating after 7 day's use 👍 almost good But charger adepter should be provid with box that is minus point only 🙄

87,3,Good,Camera quality is good .👌
88,3,Nice,The product is good.Just heats and the phone is always  warm. Absolutely bad for gaming cause its skips frame and lag quite a bit .But it can be a  good choice of phone  to  be gifted for  parents and for use of social media apps.
89,3,Nice,Good option and reccomented considering the price 👍Pros :1. Display is awesome2. Software is promising and smooth3. Camera is also pretty goodAvarage :1. Battery backup is avarage as per 6000 mAH2. Back panel is glossy easily scrachable3. The performance is decent tooCons :1. This phone has a hitting issue can be solved. with software update
90,3,Does the job,"Software problem,  you need to improve the network  signal and this Samsung galaxy f34 phone can't load of 80 application, it's going to hang out, not good for heavy work application user."
91,3,Good,Good but battery is no longer time
92,3,Does the job,"Samsung is preferred because of security ,  display and battery backupBut this mobile has terrible battery backup. I am disappointed with battery backup option. Instead of this model . I would have purchased cheaper model. 5 g is draining battery even quicker . I think for first time samsung mobile needs power bank"
93,3,Nice,"Heating issue, and it looks like battery is draining fast.Samsung! Please fix it in your patches"
