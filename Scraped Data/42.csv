154,4,Good quality product,Build quality is nice feels premium but in hand without the case is not so comfortable because of sharp edges still it is negligible as 99% of us gonna use case.Battery is huge never experienced like this level of lasting in a smart phone.i know what I'm buying but still if i should write the cons here that would be the camera zoom and the 60hz display. Overall a value for buck product.
155,4,Wonderful,"The iPhone 14 Plus offers an amazing battery life and a big display experience for under 65k, which by Apple standards is an excellent proposition. If you are looking to try out the iOS experience and get good performance, this one is a much better option. You do miss out on a newer chip, a high refresh rate display, and better cameras, but you do get your money's worth in experience and software support."
156,4,Delightful,"Battery life and cameras are excellent. Happy with the large screen, however I wish it could have come with a high refresh rate. Overall a good experience with this iPhone...since I just wanted a big screen and didn't want to spend so much more on the pro max model."
