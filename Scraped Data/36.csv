3,3,Does the job,First of all i get my delivery but the product was broken but they will replace it and i got a new one that was nice and the clarity was great
4,3,"Average picture, good sound but does not meet expectation","Ordered the TV on 09th Feb and the TV got delivered on 10th feb and the installation was done by the service person on 10th Feb itself.I can quote excellent as far as speed of delivery and installation is concerned.Coming to picture quality.....Very very average picture quality. It was inferior to my previous non-4K Kodak TV. Secondly there is no option to stretch video to fit the screen, which was available in my previous TV. I will rate 2 out of 5 as far as picture quality is concerned..."
5,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Tv looking good. Clear picture and sound. But wall mount screws not avilable for this new model. So installation Technician  set on the table only.

19,4,Delightful,"I have purchased this TV for 35k after all card offers and coupon discounts. I have bought 65 inch variant. Working is not that smooth. You can find noticeable lag in the selection page for first 2 to 5 mins when you switch on tv and later the lag is reducing and working smooth with time. Picture quality in selection page is not that great but actual picture quality of the video is great. Yes, its bit heavily saturated. You ll notice reds and greens are more vibrant but its looking good. ..."

33,5,Classy product,"Although its been only 2 days of use so I must say that it is an initial review but the first impressions of this Motorola 55 inch Smart TV are really very encouraging. The sound is a bit on the lower side, meaning we have to keep it on higher level to listen fully but picture quality is awesome. The TV satisfies the expectations remarkably. I am giving a 5 star rating to this product. I hope the experience remains the best throughout and I don't have to update my review later."
